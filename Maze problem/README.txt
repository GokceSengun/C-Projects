The program that finds a solution path of the given maze.
In my program, the first issue that confronts us is the representation of the maze. 
The obvious choice is a two dimensional array in which zeros represents the open paths and ones the barriers.
On the maze the capital letters denote doors and the small letters denote keys used for unlocking the doors.
Same letters represent key-door pairs (a > A, b > B, etc). My program finds a key to open the corresponding door.
